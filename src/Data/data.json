Owning an avian will allow you to claim $FLAP tokens regularly. Your tokens will reward you in game, in the real world, and in the metaverse. Expect loads of airdrops and unlockables ranging from in game cosmetics, other generations of Arcane Avians NFTs, collaborations with other projects, and digital 3D models and variations of your own avian. That is just a taste of what is to come. We strive to be a community based project first and foremost and are determined to reward members within the community as much as possible. Expect a ton of collaborations over time and frequent updates and engagement. we have a lot planned and hope our holders have fun along the way."
